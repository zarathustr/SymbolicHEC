# certifiable-rwhe-calibration
Certifiably globally optimal generalized robot-world and hand-eye calibration. Our algorithm is the first extrinsic calibration method that can jointly solve for the poses of multiple sensors *and* targets, consider an unknown target scale, and provide a computational certificate of global optimality for its maximum likelihood objective function. 

## Usage
See `experiments/rw_multi_eye_multi_hand.jl` for an example of how to use our software on the processed real-world data in `data/real-world/`. Each `.csv` file in `data/real-world/combine/` contains $A$ or $B$ measuerement matrices for the tag and camera indexed in its filename. For example, the $i$ th row of `tag_0_cam_0_A.csv` contains 7 floating point numbers representing a pose matrix $A_i \in \mathrm{SE}(3)$ matrix in an $A_i X_0 = Y_0 B_i$ measurement for tag 0 and camera 0: the first four are $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ of a unit quaternion representing a rotation, and the last three are a position in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
